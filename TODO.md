# TODO

- Improve API regarding STDOUT in Bot (avoid using two lines for instance)

# DONE

- Put all Buffer in Buffer.h so that can use Buffer<N> for any N
- Put Configurables & Actors into Actors
- Add a Buffer.sprintf("%d",s) for Buffer that is overflow-safe
- Refactoring on Bot & friends to remove configurables totally (API otherwise is confusing)
