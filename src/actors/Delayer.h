/**
* This actor works as a wrapper for other actors, delaying the cycle(match)
* call until a more convenient time.
* The typical use case is to reduce the electrical load in case 3 pumps are set
* to work at the same moment. Using this actor we can easily wrap the 3 pumps
* and specify an offset for each, let's say 0, 60 and 120. This way the first one
* will start as soon as a match comes, the second one 60 seconds after a match
* comes, and the third one 120 seconds after a match comes, balancing the electrical
* load.
* Note: this class must be serialized with care (contains pointers).
